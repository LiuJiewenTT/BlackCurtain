## 文件说明(Special file explanation)

The source code for `part2.exe` is very simple. It suppose to fill something into specific place. In consideration of my dissatisfaction to it and it's a non-completed version of my another project's work, I would like to not opening the codes. BUT!!! I personally support you if you try to replace it with yours! With a easy observation, you can understand how it works.
